## Axle Optimization
Optimized the axle on Astrum (2023 Solar Car) to reduce mass and deflection while prioritizing minimizing bearing resistance. This analysis will inform the design of the 2025 Solar Car axle.

Key Objectives
  - Minimize Bearing Resistance:
    -- Smaller bearings can reduce resistance which can improve overall race time.
  - Minimize Mass and Deflection:
    -- Reducing mass and maintaining or reducing deflection under every load case is critical.
    -- Load Cases:
        --- 3g bump
        --- 2g bump + 1g turn in either direction (+/- y)
        --- 2g bump + 1g brake in the direction of forward travel (x)
    -- Safety Factors:
        --- 1.5 to yield
        --- 2.0 to ultimate tensile strength (UTS)
    -- Material Selection:
       --- For the initial design, use 17-4 stainless steel or a similar, easily sourced steel or aluminum.
       --- Explore exotic materials like beryllium to understand the mass delta and its impact on race time versus cost.
    -- Axle Geometry:
       --- Explore multiple geometries to optimize stress, mass, deflection, and bearing diameter.
       --- Any changes must maintain the current bearing positions and kingpin-to-axle lengths; you can adjust bearing ID/OD however you want.

## Mule Car Chassis
Led the creation, design and manufacturing of the Mule Car Chassis on the Solar Car team in a 2 week period for the Mechanical and Electrical Divisions to test their systems and components. I created the CAD design and ran beam-bending hand calcs as well as FEA to meet safety regulations and safety factor of 1.5. I also complied a BOM and coordinated the manufacturing process (welding and waterjet) for the chassis. I had complete ownership of this project as a new member of the team.

## Tooling: Initial Upper and Lower Plug Design 
Designed tooling, the initial plugs, for the upper and lower parts of the car in Siemens NX. Communicated with the manufacturer to determine any important features to add to the tooling such as surface finish, split lines and mold lines. Researched optimal tooling board density and plug to mold composite manufacturing process for a better surface finish.
