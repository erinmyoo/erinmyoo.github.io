%% Mule Car Chassis
Led the creation, design and manufacturing of the Mule Car Chassis on the Solar Car team in a 2 week period for the Mechanical and Electrical Divisions to test their systems and components. I created the CAD design and ran beam-bending hand calcs as well as FEA to meet safety regulations and safety factor of 1.5. I also complied a BOM and coordinated the manufacturing process (welding and waterjet) for the chassis. I had complete ownership of this project as a new member of the team.
